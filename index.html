                During my undergraduate study at Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, I paid great attention to the cultivation of my own experimental skills and the study of professional theoretical knowledge. I have strong independent thinking and ability to solve practical problems. I participated in the 4th Challenge Cup of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. "College students' extracurricular academic and scientific works competition" and won the award for excellence. At the same time, I participated in the innovative learning project during the undergraduate course and published a related core journal paper. I mastered the basic animal experiment operation methods and the use of general large-scale instruments, and developed a rigorous, careful and diligent experimental style.
            </li>
            <li>
                During my master's degree at Shantou University, I paid attention to the improvement of my own scientific research ability and innovative ability. I was able to solve problems through various means, actively helping others in the laboratory, and writing academic papers and work summary skills. During the period, I published 3 SCI papers and 1 Chinese core journal. Has strong self-study and independent problem-solving ability, strong teamwork ability, strong ability to withstand pressure, and can quickly adapt to various environments. I am scientifically rigorous and conscientious, has strong research and innovation capabilities, am familiar with scientific research workflows, and has the experience and ability to write natural science fund project books. At the same time, I systematically study the basic theory of excessive chemistry, the processing method of intermolecular interaction force, and the basic theory of crystallography; skillfully use Python and Matlab to acquire and analyze computational data; manage the laboratory Linux system server, with analysis under Linux and Ability to process data; proficient in common drug design software such as Schrodinger, Discovery Studio, Sybyl, etc.; skilled in molecular dynamics simulation operations.
            </li>
            <li>
                During the work of Betta Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. , I focused on the combination of scientific research and practical application, established a small drug database related to the project, R-based fragment library. Completed target research and compound literature research. Combined with pharmacological data to analyze compound structure relationship. Designing new compounds and simulating their possible pharmacological activities. Encountering difficulties in the simulation, actively consulting the literature to find solutions, improving the ability to solve problems. Participating in the optimization of synthetic processes and related computational simulation of organic synthesis mechanisms. Report writing; through the exchange and cooperation with different colleagues in the work, improve the ability of communication and collaboration. Further work Schrodinger, Discovery Studio, Sybyl, Python and other tools to solve practical problems, enhance the use of related software and language.
            </li>
            <li>
                During my work at the Chinese University of Hong Kong(Shenzhen), I focused on combining experimental data with theoretical simulations. On the Linux system, Schrodinger and Discovery Studio were used to study the interaction between biological targets and small molecule compounds, and the structure-activity relationship of the compounds was analyzed by combining pharmacological data. At the same time, NAMD software was used to simulate the trajectories of proteins and small molecules to complete the research report writing. In addition, I also manage the laboratory linux server and maintain its normal operation. At the same time, I use Python language to analyze relevant biological experimental data and complete related research work.
